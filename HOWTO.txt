How to use astrometry and photometry codes in the PIPELINE directory
====================================================================

1) Take rawcube as input, split into 9 tiles sum to white light image
and fit WCS, return .new for each summed tile, and also splits each
tile into R G1 G2 and B, adds WCS, writes all to a dir, e.g.:

uv run iss_rawcube_tile_wcs_local_first.py ~/pCloudDrive/ACRYLIC/IMAGEFILES/ISS066E0321/20211031_162716_iss066e032138_c9cd3562_L1_rawcube.fits TESTOUT

11 of those have been set up in
./go.sh
each writing to its own TESTOUT1 2 3 ... 11


2) then search APASS for photometry

iss_tilecube_photometry_apass.py

using go2.sh

3)

Then merge their output catalogs

go_merge_catalogs.sh


4) Then plot the results

plot_merged_averaged_catalogs.Rmd

this may also be of interest: plot_results_from_tilesolver_1.Rmd
